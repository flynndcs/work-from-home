# Work From Home

Work From Home is a CRUD application for project management. It uses a React front-end, Node/Express back-end, and MySQL server hosted on AWS RDS.

## Installation

Run npm install in cloned directory and 'client' sub-directory.

Run `npm run build` in 'client' subdirectory. This will build the optimized front end React client.

Run `npm start` in root directory. This serves the application at localhost:9000. The api is also served on this same port, with Express Router handling routing.
